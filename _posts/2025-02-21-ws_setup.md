**Setting Up a Deep Learning Workstation: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Deep learning requires a robust workstation with efficient software configurations to maximize performance. Whether you're setting up a personal rig or a shared system for your research team, this guide walks you through key steps to get everything up and running smoothly.

---

### **1. Perform System Updates & Install Essentials**

Start by updating your system and installing essential tools:

```bash
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install build-essential
```

This ensures your system is up to date and has necessary development tools.

---

### **2. Enable SSH Connection**

Remote access is essential for managing your workstation efficiently. To enable SSH, run the following:


```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl status ssh
```


This allows you to connect securely to your machine from anywhere.

---

### **3. Install Git & Tmux**

For version control and terminal multiplexing, install Git and Tmux:


```bash
sudo apt install install-info git-all
sudo apt install tmux
```


---

### **4. Install NVIDIA Drivers & CUDA for GPU Acceleration**

Ensure your system has the latest NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit:


```bash
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```


Check installation:


```bash
nvidia-smi
nvcc --version
```


If NVIDIA drivers break, you can reset them:


```bash
sudo apt purge nvidia*
sudo apt purge libnvidia*
sudo apt autoremove
```


---

### **6. Install Anaconda for Package Management**

Anaconda simplifies package and environment management:


```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sudo ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```


Set installation path to:


```bash
/opt/anaconda3
```


When prompted, **do not initialize** Anaconda.

Activate and initialize Anaconda for each user upon first login:


```bash
source /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda init
```


---

### **7. Configure User Permissions & Create Users**

Set up groups and permissions:


```bash
sudo groupadd anaconda
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod simone -aG docker
sudo usermod simone -aG anaconda
```


Add new users:


```bash
sudo useradd luigi -c "Luigi Sigillo" -G anaconda --create-home -p $(openssl passwd -1 server2025) --shell /bin/bash
```


Give permissions to the Anaconda directory:


```bash
sudo chgrp -R anaconda /opt/anaconda3
sudo chmod 770 -R /opt/anaconda3
```


---

### **8. Install Docker & NVIDIA Container Toolkit**

Install Docker:


```bash
sudo apt install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```


Verify installation:


```bash
docker run hello-world
```

---

### **10. Monitoring GPU & System Performance**

Use these tools to monitor your system:

- **Check GPU usage:**
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nvtop
  nvtop
  ```
  
- **Monitor system resources:**
  
  ```bash
  htop
  ```
  
- **Check disk space:**
  
  ```bash
  sudo du -hd 1 /home | sort -h
  ```
  

---

### **Conclusion**

With this setup, your deep learning workstation will be ready for action, whether you're training models, experimenting with new architectures, or collaborating with your team. Having a structured approach to software configuration saves time and ensures a stable, high-performance environment.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
