Hey there👋, I am Luigi, a **Computer Science Engineer** 🧑‍💻 and **Ph.D. student** 🎓 in [Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/INFORMATION-AND-COMMUNICATION-TECHNOLOGY-(ICT)_nD3552_EN.aspx) at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/).

I am a member👨‍🔬 of the [ISPAMM Lab](https://www.ispamm.it/), supervised by Professor [Danilo Comminiello](https://danilocomminiello.site.uniroma1.it/).

My main research focus is *generative deep learning* 🧠, with a particular emphasis on **diffusion models** 🌫️ applied to various types of imagery 🖼️, including **aerial** 🛰️ and **medical** 🏥 images. More broadly, I’m interested in **computer vision** 👁️ and **multimodal representation learning** 🔀.

I am also a visiting researcher 🧳 at the [Visual Understanding and Generation (VUG) Lab](https://shengfenghe.github.io/group) at the [School of Computing and Information Systems, SMU](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/), working with Professor [Shengfeng He](https://shengfenghe.github.io/).

I completed the **BSc** at [Roma Tre University](https://www.uniroma3.it/) and the **MSc** at [Sapienza University Of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/), both in **Computer Science Engineering** 🎓.

Before starting the PhD, I worked as a full time **Machine Learning Engineer** 👨‍💻 for [omninext](https://omninext.it/).
