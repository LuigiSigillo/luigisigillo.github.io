Hey there👋, I am Luigi, a **Computer Science Engineer** and **Ph.D. student** in [Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/INFORMATION-AND-COMMUNICATION-TECHNOLOGY-(ICT)_nD3552_EN.aspx) at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/).

I am a member👨‍🔬 of the [ISPAMM Lab](https://www.ispamm.it/), supervised by professor [Danilo Comminiello](https://danilocomminiello.site.uniroma1.it/) and my main research topic is *generative deep learning*. 

I completed the **BSc** at [Roma Tre University](https://www.uniroma3.it/) and the **MSc** at [Sapienza University Of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/), both in **Computer Science Engineering**🎓.

Before starting the PhD, I worked as a full time **Machine Learning Engineer**👨‍💻 for [omninext](https://omninext.it/).
