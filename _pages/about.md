Hello there👋, I am Luigi Sigillo.

🧪 I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory)](https://www.embl.org/), working with the [Fabio Petroni](https://www.fabiopetroni.com/) group. We build AI solutions that combine **multimodal reasoning**, **agentic exploration**, **tool usage**, **knowledge retrieval**, and **lab-in-the-loop interaction** to accelerate scientific discovery.


<!-- I recently earned my **Ph.D. 🎓 in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)** from [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/) where I was a member👨‍🔬 of the [ISPAMM Lab](https://www.ispamm.it/), supervised by Prof. [Danilo Comminiello](https://danilocomminiello.site.uniroma1.it/). -->

🎓 I recently earned my **Ph.D. in ICT** from [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/), where I researched at the [ISPAMM Lab](https://www.ispamm.it/) under the supervision of Prof. [Danilo Comminiello](https://danilocomminiello.site.uniroma1.it/). My academic journey included a visiting position in Singapore at the [*VUG Lab*](https://shengfenghe.github.io/group) at the [School of Computing and Information Systems, SMU](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/), working with Prof. [Shengfeng He](https://shengfenghe.github.io/).


<!-- During my doctoral studies I held a visiting researcher 🧳 at the [Visual Understanding and Generation (VUG) Lab](https://shengfenghe.github.io/group) at the [School of Computing and Information Systems, SMU](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/), working with Professor [Shengfeng He](https://shengfenghe.github.io/). -->


👨‍💻 Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at [Omninext](https://omninext.it/) and completed my **MSc** at [Sapienza University Of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/) and **BSc** at [Roma Tre University](https://www.uniroma3.it/) both in Computer Science Engineering..

<!-- Before starting the PhD, I first completed the **BSc** at [Roma Tre University](https://www.uniroma3.it/) and the **MSc** at [Sapienza University Of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/), both in **Computer Science Engineering** 🎓, and then worked as a full time **Machine Learning Engineer** 👨‍💻 for [omninext](https://omninext.it/). -->


<!-- My main research focus is *generative deep learning* 🧠, with a particular emphasis on **diffusion models** 🌫️ applied to various types of imagery 🖼️, including **aerial** 🛰️ and **medical** 🏥 images. More broadly, I’m interested in **computer vision** 👁️ and **multimodal representation learning** 🔀. -->

My primary interest is **Generative Deep Learning** applied to complex domains, specifically:

* 🧪 **AI for Science:** Lab-in-the-loop systems and knowledge retrieval.
* 🌫️ **Generative Models:** Applied to complex imagery (Aerial 🛰️ & Medical 🏥).
* 👁️ **Computer Vision:** Visual understanding and synthesis.
* 🔀 **Multimodal Learning:** Bridging representations across different data modalities.
